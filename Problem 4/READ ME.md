# Sort Numbers Manually

This Python script demonstrates a simple sorting algorithm implemented manually without using built-in sorting functions.

## Description

The `sort_numbers()` function manually sorts a list of numbers by iteratively finding the smallest element, appending it to a result list, and removing it from the original list until the entire list is sorted.

### Algorithm:
1. Take the first element of the list as the current smallest value.
2. Iterate through the list to find the actual smallest value.
3. Remove the smallest value from the original list and append it to the result list.
4. Repeat the process until the original list is empty.
