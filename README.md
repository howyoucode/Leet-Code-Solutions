# Leet Code Solutions

Welcome to the **Leet Code Solutions** repository! This collection features optimized solutions to a variety of LeetCode problems. The goal of this repository is to help fellow developers and coding enthusiasts understand problem-solving approaches, improve their coding skills, and explore different algorithms and data structures.

## Structure of the Repository

The solutions are organized into folders based on problem categories:

- **Arrays & Strings**: Efficient solutions to problems involving arrays, strings, and basic data manipulation.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations and manipulations of singly and doubly linked lists, merging, reversing, and more.
- **Trees & Graphs**: Solutions for tree traversals, graph algorithms, and advanced data structures.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Problems that use memoization and principles of optimal substructure.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Algorithms for sorting and efficient search techniques.
- **Math & Bit Manipulation**: Mathematical problem-solving and operations using bitwise logic.
- **Others**: Problems that donâ€™t fit into the above categories.
