# Two Sum Problem

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.

You may assume that:
- Each input has exactly **one solution**.
- You **may not** use the same element twice.

The solution can be returned in **any order**.

### Example

#### Input:
```python
nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
